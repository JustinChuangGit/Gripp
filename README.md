## Project Description 
Gripp, our project from Hack Western 2022, addresses a gap in the market for a smart grip strength device. Informed by studies highlighting grip strength as a health indicator, Gripp not only tracks individual grip strength but also allows for comparisons within the same demographic. 

## My Contributions
I was responsible for the hardware aspect of the project as well as the 3D design. For hardware, we used a load cell amplified by a HX711 amplifier which sends data to an ESP32. I then built a pipeline in order to allow the data being processed on the ESP in C/C++ to communicate with our Python backend of the application. The physical product was designed in Solidworks and FEA preformed on the design to ensure the plastic would not deform under load. 

## Results 
Our hack won Most Novel Hack, presented by the 1517 Fund. This included a $1000 USD prize and $10k in AWS credits. Furthermore, we secured funding from The Morrissette Institute of Entrepreneurship to continue exploring the idea.
