# Gripp

Project Type:
Hardware
Embedded Software

Project Description:
Gripp was a project developed as part of Hack Western 2022. One of my teammates had read many studies indicating that grip strength was a great indicator to overall health and could give insights to things like cardiovascular health. Although there are many grip strength dynomometers on the market, there lacks a smart device that could be used to help track ones gripstrength, and provide comparisons to others in the same demographic. With this in mind we decided build Gripp - a smart grip strength device. Our hack won Most Novel Hack presented by 1517 Fund and has recived several rounds of funding from the Morrisette Institute of Entrepreneurship.
